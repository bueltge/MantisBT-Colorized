# Colorized, a MantisBT Stylesheet

Just another theme for [Mantis BugTracker](http://www.mantisbt.org/), the free web-based bugtracking system.

This style uses the magic of CSS to transform in a new style - simple, fast and useful, without images, pure css.

### Installation
 1. Download
 2. Unpack the package
 3. Create a folder: `<mantis-root>/colorized`
 4. Copy all files from the unpacked folder `colorized/*` to `<mantis_root>/colorized/`
 5. Add the following line to your `config_inc.php` to change the css file included into MantisBT:

```php
	$g_css_include_file = "colorized/colorized.css";
```

### Status Colors
If you will also use the same colors for your status graph, then copy the follow snippet in your `config_inc.php`

```php
	# --- Colors ---
	$g_status_colors['new']          = '#eeb3aa';
	$g_status_colors['feedback']     = '#badade';
	$g_status_colors['acknowledged'] = '#f5e5b8';
	$g_status_colors['confirmed']    = '#c5dba9';
	$g_status_colors['assigned']     = '#afbed5';
	$g_status_colors['resolved']     = '#c1b9ae';
	$g_status_colors['closed']       = '#e8e8e8';
```

#### More user-friendly select boxes 
You can also use the plugin [Chosen for MantisBT](https://github.com/bueltge/Chosen-for-MantisBT). Chosen is a jQuery plugin that makes long, unwieldy select boxes much more user-friendly.
